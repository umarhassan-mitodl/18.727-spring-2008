Coruse Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

The prerequisite is a first course in algebraic geometry, though the course will be mostly self-contained and we will introduce background material as needed.

Description
-----------

This semester, 18.727 will be a graduate course on algebraic surfaces. The main aims will be to go over the classification of surfaces (Engriques-Castelnuovo for characteristic zero, Bombieri-Mumford for characteristic p), while working out plenty of examples, and treating their geometry and arithmetic as far as possible. The exact choice of topics depends on the interests of the students.

Textbooks
---------

The class does not follow a single textbook. Here are some background references:

Assignments
-----------

Occasional problem sets will be handed out. Graduate students do not have to hand these in for credit, but undergraduates taking the course do. Students are encouraged to work together on the problems.
